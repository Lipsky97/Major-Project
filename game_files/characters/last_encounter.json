Angel tells Loki that he can earn more feathers by killing more gods for him. Angel insists for Loki to agree. If Loki agrees the angel will say 'may the god be with you'. If Loki refuses to work for the angel he will say 'goodbye'.\n\nTraveller: What happened?\n Angel: I healed you with the feathers you've earned during your missions. They are all gone.\n\n",
