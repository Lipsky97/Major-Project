  "desc3": "Loki just found a nice hotel in the north of Italy. It's nice and cold here and Loki being an ice giant can really appreciate it. The room is incredibly spacious and in it is everything a god can desire. Golden patterns and paintings on the walls, a large terrace, full liquor cabinet and a TV.\nLoki opened a bottle of good whisky, put soap opera on TV and finally got some well earned rest. This state of bliss did not last very long. Loki heard knocking on the door. It was a letter. Loki could feel magic aura around it.\nInside the envelope Loki found a feather and a letter. \n\n'Dear Traveller,\nGood job with Bacchus, he was hiding from us for a long time.\nLuckily, your skills proved irreplaceable and you ended\nhis miserable life. In the envelope you can find the proof of our\ngratitude.\nThis is not over though. We have another quest for you. It might\nbe a little harder though. We've tracked down Anubis, but we\ncannot reach him. All we know is that he is somewhere in Alexandria.\nMay the God be with you,\nA.'\n\n'Again? You have got to be kidding me...'\n\nLoki was not happy with this turn of events. Gods are not exactly easy to kill and Anubis is famous for being relentless. If that wasn't enough he is in Egypt.",
  "desc4": "Loki watched TV and drunk whisky till he fell asleep. Next morning he searched for the quickest transport to egypt."
