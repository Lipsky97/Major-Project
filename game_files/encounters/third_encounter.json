  "desc": "'That was too intense' thought Loki while entering the train to the airport. 'If not for Chonsu I would've been dead. I mean... I WAS dead for a moment! This cannot happen again'\n\nLoki did not want to stay in this god forgotten continent. As soon as he arrived at the airport he bught ticket to his favourite place in this realm - Iceland",
  "desc2": "Iceland is Lokis favourite country for a few reasons - first of all it's nice and cold here, second, he's got his villa here and the most important one - less than one person per square kilometer. Here he can do whatever he want without anyone bothering him. At least he could before he started to work for angels. Only few moments after Loki walked into his villa and finished unpacking he found an envelope. He recognized it immediately. Not only because he felt familiar magic aura around it, but mostly because it materialized on his coffee table out of thin air. Inside again he found a feather and a letter. \n\n'Dear Traveller,\nI hope you are fine after the fight with Anubis, we suspected he might\nbe dangerous, that is why we sent our best hitman to kill him.\nInside the envelope you can find the promised feather. It is not time\nfor rest, though. My good friend, Veles, another god of underworld, this time\nslavic. He kidnapped a human child and not a normal one. There is\na legend that says that this child is the next messiah. Now it's gone\nand you have to find it, before Veles will use its power to do something\nhorrible. He is hiding in Cracow. It's a large town on the north of Poland. Be ware though.\nRevolution recently broke out in Poland, so it might be difficult to get there.\nMay the God be with you\nA.'\n\n'At least it's not Africa again... It'll be way colder there' thought Loki.",
  "desc3": "'My good friend?' Since when are we friends?\n\nThe god of lies spent few more days at his villa, packed his things and set off to get to Poland 'before something horrible happens'"
